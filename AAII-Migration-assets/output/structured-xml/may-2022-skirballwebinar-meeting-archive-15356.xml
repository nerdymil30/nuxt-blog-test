        <title>The Future of Emerging Markets: Capturing A Rising Digital Generation</title>
        <description>The developing world is coming online at a dizzying pace. Every second, three people go online for the first time, leapfrogging two decades of Western digitization, becoming consumers from their new, cheap smartphones. Defined by McKinsey &amp; Co. as "the biggest growth opportunity in the history of capitalism," Kevin Carter gives you an on-the-ground look at the next wave of global internet giants, driven by the 5.4 billion people under age 30 in emerging and frontier markets.</description>
