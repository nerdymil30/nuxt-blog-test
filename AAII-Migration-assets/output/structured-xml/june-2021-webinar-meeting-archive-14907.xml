          <bio>Allan Roth is the founder of Wealth Logic, LLC, an hourly based financial planning and investment advisory firm. He is the author of "How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street" (Wiley &amp; Sons 2011) and writes for AARP, ETF.com, Financial Planning Magazine, and others. Before launching Wealth Logic, Allan's career encompassed management consulting with McKinsey &amp; Co., and corporate finance which included serving as financial officer at two multi-billion-dollar healthcare companies. Allan has taught finance and behavioral finance at the University of Denver, Colorado College, and the University of Colorado. Despite his many credentials (CFP, CPA, MBA), he remains confident that he can still keep investing simple. Being mocked on a semi-regular basis by some financial professionals for his hourly fee model and its obvious inability to make him rich, is a source of pride for Allan. His professional goal is to never be confused with Jim Cramer.</bio>
