        <title>2021: For Investors, a Year of Promise--or Peril?</title>
        <description>As investors close the books on 2020 many can't help but feel a bit uncomfortable. While 270,000 Americans perished from COVID, and tens of millions either lost their jobs or saw their work hours slashed, the stock market hit record highs. Bond holders, too, made money as the Fed held its key interest rate near zero, boosting the value of older bonds. As 2021 dawns, the key question is whether elevated stock and bond prices already reflect virtually all of what could go right for for the US and global economies in the new year--and very little of what could go wrong.</description>

        <title>2021 Global Market Outlook</title>
        <description>Our Global Market Outlook for 2021 includes a vaccine-lead broad based market recovery, with the new market cycle bringing on new leadership by international stocks. For the global economic recovery, we look for a successful end to lockdowns this winter, followed by mass immunizations in the spring, and a sharp rebound of economic activity in virus-depressed sectors by summer. Economic and earnings growth are likely to exceed that of the U.S. for the first time in years, supporting relative outperformance of international stocks.</description>
