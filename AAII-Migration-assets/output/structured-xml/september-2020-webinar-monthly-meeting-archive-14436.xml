        <title>How Investors can Survive and Thrive in a World Gone Mad!</title>
        <description>We are in an environment of extreme uncertainty. It's a challenge to craft an outlook during a pandemic, and so we will explore five possible scenarios. The shape of the recovery is of course dependent on a variety of factors: infection rates, fiscal policy, monetary policy, public health policy (including the stringency of lockdowns), and progress toward the development of therapies and a vaccine. It is also impacted by consumer and business behavior. We will explore all these factors, and discuss how we arrived at our base case scenario. We will also discuss investment implications.</description>
