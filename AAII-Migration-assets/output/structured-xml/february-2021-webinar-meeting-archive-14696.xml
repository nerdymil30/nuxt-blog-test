        <title>Saturday, February 20, 2021</title>
        <description>In this presentation, Mr. Hulbert will report on the distinct patterns that have emerged from his 40+ year database of investment newsletter recommendations. As expected by contrarian analysis, the markets tend to struggle in the wake of extreme bullishness--and vice versa. Armed with this historical context, Mr. Hulbert will discuss current market timer sentiment in the stock, gold and bond arenas and what it signifies.</description>
