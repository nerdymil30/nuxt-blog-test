        <title>Empowering Wealth Creation: Unlocking Actionable U.S. Stock Market Insights with Trivector Research</title>
        <description>Adam Parker brings 20 years of experience in equities, including four years on the buy side and 18 years on sell side to Trivector Research. Prior to Trivector Research, Adam was the founder and lead portfolio manager of Trivector Capital, an equity long/short hedge fund. From 2017-2019 Adam worked as the Director of Quantitative Strategy at Eminence Capital, reporting to the CEO and Founder. In this role, he was responsible for building a quantitative infrastructure to conduct analysis around single stock research; risk management; diagnostics of prior trades to improving sizing and timing; and macro research. Between 2010 and early 2017, Adam was the Chief US Equity Strategist and Director of Global Quantitative Research at Morgan Stanley, where he was acknowledged as a top strategist and quantitative researcher multiple times by Institutional Investor magazine and named the #1 Strategist by portfolio managers in Greenwich Associates’ Greenwich Survey. Adam was a member of Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee, a seven-person group responsible for asset allocation recommendations for the firm’s $2 trillion private wealth network. Prolific in publishing research, Adam co-authored a ground-breaking paper on gender diversity as a risk factor. In addition to developing equity models and risk management tools, he managed a long-only paper portfolio of approximately 50 US stocks that was published on a weekly basis and strongly outperformed the market over six years. In the weekly Global Macro Forum he ran, Adam shared his research and insights on key macro issues with colleagues and clients. From June 1999 to August 2010, Adam worked at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., which he joined as a Junior Quantitative Researcher. Quickly promoted to the role of fundamental US semiconductor analyst in 2001, Adam was the #1 Institutional Investor-ranked semiconductor analyst from 2004-2006. In 2007, he was promoted to the role of Global Director of Research, responsible for attracting, hiring and retaining key talent in New York and London. In 2008, Adam took over as the US Equity Strategist and Global Director of Quantitative Research, where he was again recognized by both Institutional Investor and the Greenwich Survey as a top strategist and quantitative researcher. Adam holds a Ph.D. in Statistics from Boston University, an MS in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and a BS in Statistics from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.</description>
