        <title>Asset Allocation: When Conventional Wisdom Fails</title>
        <description>Is diversification a flawed concept? Should you always play it safe with your retirement savings? What's your most important investment decision? Can we forecast the future in capital markets? This presentation will dispel myths in asset allocation. Sebastien Page's book, "Beyond Diversification," relies on over 200 academic papers, investment insights from his colleagues, his 20+ years of experience in investment management, and wisdom from his father. In addition to addressing some of the big questions in asset allocation, Sebastien will discuss the current investment environment. He will address the impact of low interest rates, and whether the 60/40 portfolio is "dead".</description>

        <title>Good Riddance to 2020: Economic &amp; Market Outlook, 2021 and Beyond</title>
        <description>2020 brought unprecedented disruption to the entire world economy, and a stunning 34% drop in the stock market in a matter of weeks. Since then, the markets have rebounded, shot past new highs, and the global economy is projected to grow at a faster rate than at any time since rebounding off the recession of 1979/1980. Michael Farr teases the threads of globalization, technology, monetary largesse, and rebounding demand to give his thoughts on where new opportunities -and emerging threats- lie in the post pandemic world.</description>
