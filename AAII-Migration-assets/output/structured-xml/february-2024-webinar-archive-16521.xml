          <bio>Ivory Johnson's ability to communicate intricate financial issues into easy-to-understand terms has served his clients well. With over two decades of helping families and small businesses create and protect wealth, he has seen the benefits of developing a financial game-plan.

        <title>How to Play the Odds of Today</title>
        <description>The merits of a decision should be judged by the process and not solely on the outcome. In this sense, projecting an absolute result is less preferable than identifying the odds of success. This talk will review the current macroeconomic environment and what courses of action are likely to yield the best results.</description>

        <title>The Future of Emerging Markets &amp; the Rise of a Digital India</title>
        <description>India’s thriving economy and favorable demographics are creating a digital golden age, presenting an alternative emerging market exposure to China. The country is on track to be the third-largest economy in the world by the decade’s end according to Morgan Stanley. We believe that the time to invest in India is now and that the India Internet &amp; Ecommerce Index (ticker: INQQ) could be one way for investors to gain exposure to the growth occurring today.</description>
