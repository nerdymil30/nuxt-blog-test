        <title>Tug-of-War--Who Wins in 2022?</title>
        <description>The market has been in a tug-of-war for the majority of the year and the question is which side will be able to finally pull the rope all the way over? We have earnings and a strong consumer on one side versus high valuations and inflation on the other. We will walk through our analysis of the economy and discuss where we see all the factors landing over the next 12-18 months including which sectors may have the greatest support in this environment.</description>
