        <title>Plenty of Fiscal and Monetary Stimulus! Has it been overdone?</title>
        <description>The presentation will cover the results of the enormous fiscal stimulus already provided (and contemplated) by the U.S. Government, and the presumed economic outlook. Likewise, it will peruse the extent and effects of the ballooning amount of monetary stimulus being provided by the Central Banks around the globe. Taking into account the staggering geopolitical factors shaping economies and markets, the outlook for stock and bond markets will be discussed.</description>
        <learning_outcomes>
          <outcome>Has too much fiscal stimulus been undertaken to deal with the pandemic economy?</outcome>
          <outcome>Are central banks underplaying the inflation risk of over-printing to provide the funds for the enormous stimulus (and debt) underway?</outcome>
          <outcome>When including the geopolitical outlook, have stock and bond markets "over" discounted the upside potential?</outcome>

        <title>Economic &amp; Investment Outlook for a Post-Pandemic World</title>
        <description>How has the pandemic permanently changed the U.S. economy and the rest of the world, once it is finally defeated? Will the future of inflation be of a transitory nature or permanently higher going forward? How high will inflation be, and what will be the impact on interest rates? Given these new and emerging macro-economic trends what sectors and industry groups will thrive and which will do poorly in the new post-pandemic world? Don't miss Jason Trennert's presentation as he explores these questions and more, in order to help investors navigate the current macro environment.</description>
