        <title>The Art of Corporate Body Language</title>
        <description>Corporate body language represents the non-verbal cues companies give the marketplace about their financial well-being, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is typically seen when companies change the date/time of a corporate event, or the content of that event. In the current trading environment, investors need to be a little more discerning when looking at data. The more information you have the better. Use this in conjunction with other bespoke data to build out your trading mosaic. Investors who track these changes can generate additional alpha or avoid risk in their portfolios. Academic research shows for example that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it’s typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier would suggest the opposite.</description>

        <title>2 Funds to Own Forever, and How to Invest in Small Caps</title>
        <description>Few equity styles generate as much love and hate as small-cap value. It boasts impressive long-term returns, but the ride can be rocky. The silver lining to that dark cloud is diversification. Portfolios that include an allocation to small-cap value have increased returns more than they've increased risk and been more resilient. For more conservative investors, Paul shows investors the long term risk and return of adding large value, small cap growth and small cap value to the S&amp;P or Total Market Index.</description>
