        <title>Guaranteed Income: The Forgotten Household Asset</title>
        <description>Guaranteed income is the largest financial asset for most retirees, yet its role in a financial plan is generally quite minor, treated simply as a cash flow that can be used to fund the retirement liability. Explore why financial planners need to consider guaranteed income more fully, since doing so can have significant implications on optimal investment spending strategies. Topics about guaranteed income discussed include: its role on the balance sheet, its impact on portfolios, how it affects optimal spending strategies and why it's worth more than other assets, especially today.</description>
        <learning_outcomes>
          <outcome>How to evaluate the benefit of guaranteed income and why the probability of success is the wrong metric to assess its value</outcome>
          <outcome>How guaranteed income should be considered as part of a balanced sheet and statement of cash flows</outcome>
          <outcome>Realize the impact of guaranteed income on optimal spending strategies, including a review of how it is a more valuable asset than a traditional portfolio, especially in today's environment</outcome>
