        <title>2022: Policy Normalization and the End of TINA.</title>
        <description>Financial markets have been heavily distorted by TINA ("there is no alternative"). Central banks, via their approach to monetary policy post the financial crisis, have forced investors up the risk curve, aided and abetted speculation and underwritten high valuations in many parts of the global financial market. With normalization of policy set to begin in earnest, the key question for investors is the following: What effect will the start of that normalization have on TINA? Has TINA created a bubble? If so, where? And how, therefore, will that impact the behavior of asset prices across the globe in 2022 and beyond? In short, how should investors position their portfolios in 2022?</description>
