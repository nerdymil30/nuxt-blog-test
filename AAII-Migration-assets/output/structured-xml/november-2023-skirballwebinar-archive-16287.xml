        <title>AAII Los Angeles Chapter “Investor Journey” Panel Session</title>
        <description>Come hear how four of our Chapter members are managing their portfolios on their respective Investor Journey, each succeeding while being on a different path. Two of our panelists are “Do It Yourselfers,” one is a “Semi Do It Yourselfer” and one relies that a CFP and robo-advisor to manage most of their portfolio. Learn about the experiences and frustrations two of our panelists had while working with Financial Advisors and what action they took. Also learn how one of our panelists developed a unique hourly compensation model instead of the typical AUM fee. And finally, learn how our panelists seek to get their spouses involved and how differing investment styles/approaches can all be successful.</description>
