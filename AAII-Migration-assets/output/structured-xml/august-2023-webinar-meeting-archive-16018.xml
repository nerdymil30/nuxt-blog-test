        <title>Why Most Investors Underperform</title>
        <description>The investment management industry has long focused on specializing in particular investment styles or investing in a specific style box. This methodology has led many professional and individual investors to dramatically underperform equity markets over time. In our experience, a style-agnostic approach leads to superior performance, a broader investment universe and better diversified investment portfolios.</description>

          <bio>Kevin Simpson is the CIO/Founder of Capital Wealth Planning, a $8B money manager based in Naples FL. The firm was founded almost 20 years ago with the premise of investing in blue-chip companies that have a history of raising their dividends and coupling it with covered call writing will lead to less volatility on the market and still achieve wealth over time. The ability to share these two important investment strategies to help improve returns is a passion that Kevin enjoys sharing.</bio>
