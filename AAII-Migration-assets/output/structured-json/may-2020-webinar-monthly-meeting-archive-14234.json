          "bio": "Mitch Tuchman began his career at Atari and spent the first half of his career a Silicon Valley software entrepreneur when he sold two start-ups during the dot-com period. He then entered investment management with Apex Capital where he oversaw a $200 million technology portfolio, co-managed its venture capital fund and served as a director of four Nasdaq companies as an activist investor. He observed the commission-based broker model pervasive in the financial services industry resulting in most investors suffering poor returns and saw an opportunity to use technology to lower costs and emulate the best practices on sophisticated endowments such as Yale and Harvard, founding the first robo-adviser, MarketRiders in 2008. Recognizing that robo-advisers needed a human touch, in 2012 he partnered with Scott Puritz to form Rebalance. Today, Rebalance manages $800 million in client assets. Tuchman received his B.S. at Boston University and MBA from the Harvard Business School.",

He will share with you the hard truths about why the average investor achieves returns lower than inflation and less than half of a balanced stock and bond portfolio and, in doing so, how investors' money is sent on a one-way trip to Wall Street's coffers. He will then outline a simple approach for any investor to grow their savings in a fast and safe way.",
