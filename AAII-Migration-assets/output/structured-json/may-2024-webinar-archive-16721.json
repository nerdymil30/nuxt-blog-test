        "description": "In this talk David Bahnsen will explain why dividend growth stocks represent a better value proposition than big cap growth stocks or technology stocks. Also, why is there so much more inherent risk in the markets then investors currently realize and what can investors do now to better position their portfolios for the current economic environment. Attend this talk and learn the real reasons why the economy has not gone into recession and why the experts got it so wrong.",

          "Why the macroeconomic landscape  suggests greater respect for risk than many are willing to give markets right now"

        "title": "A New Policy Paradigm?",
        "description": "Doug will discuss the extremely unusual economic recovery that’s unfolded following the COVID pandemic. Aided by extremely loose monetary and fiscal policies, the U.S. economy “overshot” in 2002, producing an inflation rate that peaked at over 9% in June 2022. In response to that inflation surge, Fed Reserve slammed on the monetary brakes, but deficit spending continued to soar. Can loose fiscal policy offset the impact of monetary tightening on both the U.S. economy and the stock market?",
        "learning_outcomes": [
          "Linkages between the economy and stock market are unstable over time",
          "Huge federal deficits have had a strong correlation with high corporate profit margins",
          "Stock market returns over the last decade have been supported by an escalation in both P/E multiples\nand corporate profit margins. That’s been an extremely rewarding combination, but seems very unlikely\nto be repeated in the next 5-10 years"
