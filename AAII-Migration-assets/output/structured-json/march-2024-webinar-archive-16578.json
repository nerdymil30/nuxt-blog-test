In this role, he was responsible for building a quantitative infrastructure to conduct analysis around single stock research; risk management; diagnostics of prior trades to improving sizing and timing; and macro research. Between 2010 and early 2017, Adam was the Chief US Equity Strategist and Director of Global Quantitative Research at Morgan Stanley, where he was acknowledged as a top strategist and quantitative researcher multiple times by Institutional Investor magazine and named the #1 Strategist by portfolio managers in Greenwich Associates’ Greenwich Survey. Adam was a member of Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee, a seven-person group responsible for asset allocation recommendations for the firm’s $2 trillion private wealth network. Prolific in publishing research, Adam co-authored a ground-breaking paper on gender diversity as a risk factor. In addition to developing equity models and risk management tools, he managed a long-only paper portfolio of approximately 50 US stocks that was published on a weekly basis and strongly outperformed the market over six years. In the weekly Global Macro Forum he ran, Adam shared his research and insights on key macro issues with colleagues and clients. From June 1999 to August 2010, Adam worked at Sanford C.
