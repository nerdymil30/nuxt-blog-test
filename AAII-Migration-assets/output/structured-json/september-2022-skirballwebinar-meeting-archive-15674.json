        "description": "This fall marks the 40th anniversary of the equity bull market during which equity markets have generated an impressive 11.7% annualized return. What underlying conditions created such a favorable environment and how are market conditions changing today? What drove the rise of indexing and what might we expect from active management going forward? Can investors balance sustainability goals (related to environmental, social, and governance goals) and return goals? How effective have asset class diversification strategies been and what are expected returns going forward?",

        "title": "Navigating the Hyper-Stagflationary Crisis, and protect your portfolio",
        "description": "This presentation will look at a number of elements that have produced intractable inflation and how Federal Reserve Policy is now boxed into a horrible, and likely permanent corner. From 1966 to 1981, the stock market experienced what was termed the Invisible Crash, as U.S. stock market indices lost over 70% of their purchasing power over 16 years. The current situation is likely to be a more volatile and even larger version of the same phenomenon. This presentation will show investors how they can combat what is innately a very hostile climate and reverse that polarity so they can benefit and grow their wealth over time, using but not limited to, precious metal and mining stocks.",

          "Learn about a little understood segment of the precious metals arena, that at the right time, could generate huge percentage returns, and how to zero in on some of the best ideas"
