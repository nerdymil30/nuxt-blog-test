        "description": "Since World War II, inflation (CPI) over 5% has preceded a recession every time. Oil prices doubling relative to the prior 2 year average ($54 in this case) has preceded a recession every time. 10 of the 13 prior recessions have been preceded by a tightening cycle by the Fed. 10 of the last 13 recessions have been preceded by the 10-year yield going below the 2-year yield. Any one of the above has a great track record in predicting a recession, but all of them have now occurred. This is not good for stock prices with valuations still extremely high.",

        "description": "In 2014 White Coat Investor wrote a column entitled, \"150 Portfolios Better Than Yours.\" The article included a link to a list of almost every popular model portfolio including recommendations from Vanguard, Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, Betterment, and a host of others. The list is now over 200. In this presentation Paul compares the range of returns from many of the portfolios, plus his own recommended portfolios. The 52-year returns of the all-equity combinations ranged from less than 10 to over 14 percent. The study reviews the risks and the returns of the portfolios. Paul explores 6 different risk measurements that would help investors select the best portfolio for their needs.",
