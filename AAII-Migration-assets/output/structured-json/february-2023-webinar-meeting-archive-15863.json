        "description": "Doug Ramsey will discuss how current trends in the economy shape the backdrop for stock and bond investors. Entering 2023, a majority of professional economic forecasts expected the U.S. economy to fall into recession sometime this year. Are their fears warranted, and if so, to what extent have prices of financial assets already compensated for that possibility?",
        "learning_outcomes": [
          "How this cycle’s upswing in inflation differs radically from the high inflation periods of the past, and why inflation could drop to surprisingly low levels by the end of the year",
          "How stock prices not only anticipate future economic developments, but play an important role in shaping those developments",
          "Why the monitoring of technical market developments can be useful to fundamental investors"
