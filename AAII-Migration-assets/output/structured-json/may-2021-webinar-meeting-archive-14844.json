Can we forecast the future in capital markets? This presentation will dispel myths in asset allocation. Sebastien Page's book, \"Beyond Diversification,\" relies on over 200 academic papers, investment insights from his colleagues, his 20+ years of experience in investment management, and wisdom from his father. In addition to addressing some of the big questions in asset allocation, Sebastien will discuss the current investment environment.

Michael Farr teases the threads of globalization, technology, monetary largesse, and rebounding demand to give his thoughts on where new opportunities -and emerging threats- lie in the post pandemic world.",
