          "bio": "Barry Goldsmith is a retiree and retail stock market investor. He has been married to his wife for 22 years and they live in Woodland Hills, California. He has been a member of AAII for several years. He holds an Associate Degree in Drafting and Design Technology from Penn State University and a Bachelor of Science degree in Management and Marketing from Rutgers University. Barry spent thirty nine years employed at the Boeing vertical Lift facility in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. While employed at Boeing, Barry was responsible for various design improvements, test programs, and post production support programs for special mission specific modifications for both the US Army and RAF fleet of CH-47 Chinook helicopters. Barry has been retired for eleven years and since retirement he has focused his attention to educating himself on understanding the mechanics of investing and the operations of the stock market. Barry’s education has included a foundation of classes in accounting, finance, economics and marketing while pursuing his Bachelor’s degree. Once he was retired, he devoted himself, to attending AAII guest speaker seminars, AAII SIGs, and AAII Webinars. Additionally, Barry took several on-line, real time courses on investing, provided by TD Ameritrade. He regularly reads Barron’s magazine and has read several investing and financial philosophical books. His investing style has evolved, but is based on experience and would be considered eclectic. It tends to lean toward conservative. The limited use of options contracts provides for occasional cash infusions to whatever account where they are being applied. Barry’s background in engineering and hobby of judging antique cars, has taught him to look into the details of any company’s fundamentals and technicals, prior to a prospective stock purchase. Barry does not proclaim to be an expert investor, but just an everyday person continuing to explore ways to maintain his and his wife’s modest lifestyle by using their portfolios to supplement his and her modest income from Social Security payments and pensions.",
