        "description": "In coming decades, demographic change will bring fundamental economic changes in the US and the global economy. Population and labor force growth will slow, populations in upper income countries will age, and lower income countries will experience demographic dividends as their labor forces grow faster than their populations. There will be many results, including: global GDP growth rates and interest rates falling, rising wages in high income countries along with rising living standards in developing countries. High income countries will experience rising government debt levels but the effect on per capital consumption are uncertain.",

          "Population aging in upper middle income and high income countries will bring rising capital per worker, continuing to depress interest rates while raising wages",
          "Demographic change will raise living standards in many developing countries but in high income countries it will push up government debt; net effects on per capita consumption are uncertain"
