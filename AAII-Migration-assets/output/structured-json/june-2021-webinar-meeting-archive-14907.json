Despite his many credentials (CFP, CPA, MBA), he remains confident that he can still keep investing simple. Being mocked on a semi-regular basis by some financial professionals for his hourly fee model and its obvious inability to make him rich, is a source of pride for Allan. His professional goal is to never be confused with Jim Cramer.",
