        "description": "The global economy is on the verge of changes that will shape how we do business, how we build wealth and how the banking system operates. Much of our experience as business people, investors and bankers has been rooted in a world where interest rates have been in secular decline, credit creation has been abundant, resources have been abundant, population has grown at the fastest pace in history and markets have expanded. We now face a future where interest rates will normalize higher, globalization will unwind and the largest segment of the population will be older. While the challenges are abundant, so too are the opportunities.",

        "title": "How do you make money in a world where the financial experts are almost always wrong?",
        "description": "In the past four years, the experts (investment banks, Federal Reserve, the Conference Board, CNBC, etc.) have been mostly wrong about their market projections. The magnitude of the variance between projection and reality has been enormous. In 2020, we had a pandemic and economic shut-down. The S&P 500 appreciated 18%. In 2021, the negative effects of the pandemic were supposed to hold the stock market back. The S&P 500 was up 28%. In 2022, there supposedly was no recession but the S&P 500 had an intra-year decline of 25% and there were two sequential quarters of negative GDP growth. In 2023, we entered the year with the most predicted recession in history and an expected S&P 500 earnings collapse. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up 19% on better than expected earnings and GDP growth. The talk will review some of the reasons for the forecasting errors and focus on actionable investment ideas that have worked and should keep working in this highly uncertain investment environment.",
