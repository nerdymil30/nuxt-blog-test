        "title": "Learning to Thrive in Retirement",
        "description": "A unique discussion on how to plan for retirement, based on the adventures of Lewis & Clark and the planning and agility required to successfully complete their journey across the American West. We'll explore the planning Lewis & Clark undertook prior to their departure, the adjustments they made en route, and the key takeaways we can all apply as we plan for our journey into the unknown world of retirement. Lessons are often more memorable when shared as stories, and this webinar will weave together the story of Lewis & Clark, the parallels between their journey and your personal journey into the vast unknown. By applying the principles they applied, you'll come away with a new perspective on how best to conquer and thrive on the frontier of retirement.",
