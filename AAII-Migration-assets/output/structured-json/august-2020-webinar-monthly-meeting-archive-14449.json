Then, he will delve into the most basic market lesson to learn from the COVID-19 experience that you can apply broadly to other market phenomena, and why the 2020's weak 1st half, tied to 2019, tells you nothing about it's back half. Ken will further delve into more specific views about how he sees markets for the back half of 2020 and into 2021 focusing on tools he has long utilized including the Pessimism of Disbelief and Confirmation Bias.",
