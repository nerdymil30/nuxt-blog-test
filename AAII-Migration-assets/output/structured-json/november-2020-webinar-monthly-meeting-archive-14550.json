        "description": "Much has been made about the death of active management. Indeed, tech darlings like Amazon and Netflix have powered much of the global equity market's returns in recent years. The goal of the FPA Crescent Fund is to generate equity-like returns over the long-term but take less risk than the stock market. Over more than two decades of investing, FPA Crescent has delivered on its stated goals. But in the face of seemingly infinite money printing, active management's future appears less certain. Join Steve for a dynamic conversation on how to navigate the current economic environment without exposing investor capital to the myriad of risks in today's equity and debt markets.",

          "Differentiated, global multi-asset strategies with an absolute return focus like FPA Crescent may provide good risk-adjusted returns over full market cycles"

        "title": "What Does the 2020 Election Mean for Your Retirement?",
        "description": "Elections have consequences. This has become a popular phrase in politics over the past few years, but the reality is elections do have consequences for your finances, especially your retirement. With many crucial retirement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid experiencing funding issues, reform could be on the way, and the election will impact the direction of reform. The markets like certainty, and uncertainty can create volatility, so where will this election cycle leave the markets? I often describe retirement planning like trying to hit a moving target in the wind. Elections can change the way the wind blows and the course of your retirement plan.",
