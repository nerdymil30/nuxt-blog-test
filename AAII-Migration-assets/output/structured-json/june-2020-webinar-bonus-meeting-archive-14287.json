        "description": "Before COVID, for many years almost no higher risk investments were \"cheap\" and investors struggled to find investment options with ample yields. With the economy partially shut down, interest rates are at or near historic lows, but now many riskier long term investments are much cheaper and offer arguably better values, if you assume coronavirus eventually goes away and the economy recovers. This session will discuss opinions and data about the two major long-term ownership investments (Real Estate and Stocks) and which offers the best value and risk/return tradeoff.",
        "learning_outcomes": [
          "Surveys about the best long term investments have found a clear favorite and you'll learn those results, how they have varied, as well as whether the opinions are consistent with the actual data",
          "Learn about the long term returns from various types of real estate and what we can learn from the experience of institutional investors",
          "Learn about the different real estate investing options available to individual investors, advantages of REITS, and differences relative to \"doing it yourself\""
