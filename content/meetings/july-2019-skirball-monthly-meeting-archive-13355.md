    speaker: "JACK BOWERS"
    keyPoints:
      - "Automakers are racing for survival, because any firms that don't have a ride-sharing model(or partner) may find themselves on thin ice once cheap ride-sharing services cause consumers to delay vehicle replacements."
      - "Peak oil demand could come much sooner than expected as electric buses, electric ride-sharing services, drones, and short-range electric aircraft displace the existing transportation system."
      - "Consumer car insurance companies may be sitting ducks. Ride-sharing firms are likely to self-insure or partner with insurance firms. Even among consumers who still buy and drive their own cars, accident-avoidance technology and driver tracking could cause rate for good drivers to plunge."
